# Hunting-of-Exoplanets
Hunting of exoplanets using machine learning
I have made this project for my first competition in which I have to find a star of solar system that it is exoplanet or not this model provides result with a good accuracy of approx. 85 percent. 
EXOPLANETS: 
An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system.
- DISCOVERY: The first confirmed exoplanet was found in 1992 around a pulsar. The first around a Sun-like star came in 1995.
- NUMBERS: As of late 2025, over 6,000 exoplanets have been confirmed in more than 4,500 planetary systems, with many systems hosting multiple planets.

Studying exoplanets helps us:
- Understand how planetary systems form and evolve.
- Search for potentially habitable worlds.
- Explore the possibility of life beyond Earth.
